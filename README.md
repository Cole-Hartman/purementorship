## Project Overview
The primary goal of this internship project was to rebuild the Pure Mentorship company website using a more modern and scalable architecture. This involved transitioning to a new tech stack to improve maintainability and future development.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui

## Current Project State
As of July 2024, the website rebuild has reached the following state:

1. Functional static website
2. Modern architecture implemented
3. Core pages and navigation in place
4. Boilerplate setup for blog page (not fully implemented)

## Completed Tasks
- Set up React project structure
- Implemented Tailwind CSS for styling
- Created main page layouts
- Established basic navigation

## Pending Tasks
The following items need attention from future interns:

1. Content Population:
   - Add missing links
   - Insert remaining images
   - Complete detail sections across the site

2. Blog Section:
   - The blog currently has a static component structure. Meaning that there is no external source generating the blog section. For the future it would be efficient to pull the data externally and render it dynamically.
   - Discuss blog data source with Diane.

3. Dynamic Content:
   - Identify areas where dynamic content could enhance user experience
   - Implement API calls to serve dynamic content where appropriate

4. Testing and Optimization:
   - Conduct thorough testing across different devices and browsers
   - Optimize performance, especially image loading and page speed

5. Documentation:
   - Create or update technical documentation for the new architecture
   - Document any custom components or functions created during development

## Future Considerations
1. Image Optimization: When the website first loads the images take some time to render. Consider optimizing this. 
2. Missing content: domain name, carousel images, quotes, and calendly links for mentor / mentee applications. 

## Handover Notes
1. Development environment setup instructions can be found in the README.md file
2. The current hosting solution is: https://purementorship.netlify.app/


## Running the Project Locally

This project is a basic Vite app. To run it locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Cole-Hartman/purementorship.git
   cd purementorship
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the local server address (typically `http://localhost:5173` or as indicated in the terminal output).

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system before running these commands.
